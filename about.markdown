I'm a undergraduate at NYU, majoring in computer science. I have a particular focus on machine learning. I'm currently interested in interpretability and uncertainty quantification. 

Here are some random topics I have vague interest in learning about. These interests have yet to coagulate into any specific experiments...

DNN Interpretability:
- Neural Tangent Kernel
- Mechanistic Interpetability
- Neural Collapse

Uncertainty Quantification:
- Conformal Prediction
- Bayesian Deep Learning

Probabilistic Classical Stats:
- Probabilistic PCA is a generally good method for finding the number of principal components which explain the data. I'm wondering if there's a way to find the optimal number of clusters, i.e. a probabilistic k-means or probabilistic GMMs.
