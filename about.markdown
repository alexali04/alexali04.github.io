I am a machine learning researcher and engineer, starting at [Persimmons](https://persimmons.ai/) on chiplet design in February 2026 in San Jose, California. I graduated from NYU in December 2025 with a B.A. in Computer Science and have been working with Professor Andrew G. Wilson and his research group.
