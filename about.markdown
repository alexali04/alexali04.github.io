I'm a undergraduate at NYU, majoring in computer science. I have a particular focus on machine learning. I'm currently interested in interpretability and uncertainty quantification. I'm currently doing research with Professor Andrew G. Wilson. [Check out my resume!]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume_alex_ali.pdf)


Here are some topics I find interesting.

Machine Learning Phenomena:
- Double Descent
- Benign Overfitting
- Grokking
- Neural Collapse

Interpretability:
- Neural Tangent Kernel
- Mechanistic Interpetability

Uncertainty Quantification:
- Conformal Prediction
- Bayesian Deep Learning

Probabilistic Classical Stats:
- Probabilistic PCA is a generally good method for finding the number of principal components which explain the data. I'm wondering if there's a way to find the optimal number of clusters, i.e. a probabilistic k-means or probabilistic GMMs.
